Hi, my name is Eronides Neto, you can call me **Eron**. I have a MSc in computer science and a BSc in Electronic Engineering. Currently, I'm working as an Embedded Systems Engineer at CESAR (@inovacaocesar). My main activities are related to the development of proof of concept and prototype of innovative solutions.

Skills involved in my main tasks:

- PCB Design (Altium Designer)
- Firmware development (C, C++ and Python)
- Hardware testing: planning and execution of hardware automated and manual tests
- Data Analysis 

# Work in progress..

Iâ€™m currently working on an IoT project that involves the use of Sigfox technology to develop a medical product to assist people that are being treated with oxygen therapy.


# Always learning

- Iâ€™m currently learning more about machine learning techniques and data science applied to finance and 5G networks.

# Research Projects 

- carOBD database

carOBD is a open-source repository, that describes an OBD-II dataset adquired during my master thesis *If you use PLEASE CITE MY ARTCILE AS REFERENCE OF THE DATABASE*. The work of my master thesis (`Detecting Anomalies in the Engine Coolant Sensor Using One-Class Classifiers`) are available ate [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8891367).

# Colaboration 

Please feel free to contact/ask me about IoT with hardware/firmware development. I'm also a member of The Things Network community in my city, Recife-PE, Brazil.
